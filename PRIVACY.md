# Privacy Policy

**Termux App Store** respects your privacy.

This document explains what data is (and is not) collected when you use this software.

---

## 🔒 Offline-First Design

Termux App Store is designed to operate **locally on your device**.

- No account required
- No login system
- No user profiling
- No telemetry

The application does **not** intentionally collect personal data.

---

## 📡 Network Access

Network access may occur **only** for the following purposes:

- Downloading source code during package builds
- Fetching upstream dependencies
- Accessing public repositories defined in build scripts

All network activity is:
- Explicit
- Initiated by user actions (e.g. installing a package)
- Subject to upstream source availability

---

## 📁 Local Data Storage

The application may store the following **locally** on your device:

- Cached package metadata
- Build artifacts
- Temporary files
- Logs related to build output
- Binary executables

All stored data:
- Remains on your device
- Is not transmitted to the project maintainers
- Can be removed by deleting the application directory

- Names
- Email addresses

## 🔐 Third-Party Code & Dependencies

Package builds may include third-party source code.

- Third-party software is governed by its own privacy policies

---

## 🧪 Binary Releases

Binary distributions:

- Do not embed tracking mechanisms
- Do not include analytics frameworks

## 🛡️ Security Practices

While reasonable precautions are taken:

- No system-level permissions are requested beyond Termux scope

- No persistent network listeners are started

Users are encouraged to:
- Audit source code

- Build from source if higher assurance is required
